We want to generate e-shop data sets.
 - sessions/visits
 - searches

 - customers +

 - orders
 - order_items

0 visists 1st day -> everything else should be 0

if visits is 1 -> we have new user (registering) + 1 user, we might have user performed search -> +1 user had both something +1 to orders

visits 5 -> 1 user
visits 5 -> 3 new 
visits 5 -> 1 old user, 1 new user , 3 they didn't do anything else
